# Text Processing in Python using Gensim

## Project Description
This project showcases the capabilities of text processing in Python, utilizing the Gensim library to perform various natural language processing tasks. The repository contains demonstrations of text preprocessing, topic modeling, similarity queries, and more, to provide insights into textual data.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text data for analysis.
- **Topic Modeling**: Discovering hidden topics in large volumes of text using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
- **Similarity Queries**: Assessing the similarity between documents using Gensim's similarities module.
- **Interactive Demonstrations**: Jupyter notebooks that guide users through various NLP techniques step-by-step.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with Jupyter notebooks and the Gensim library. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahi4127/Text-Processing-in-Python-Gensim.git
cd Text-Processing-in-Python-Gensim
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
